You roll a 5.
You are battling against the Productive Copper Pinniped.
The enemy dodges, but the user strikes a glancing blow. The user’s panic is reduced by 1.
The enemy loses 3 health points.

+------------------+----+
| YOUR STAMINA     |  3 |
| YOUR PANIC LEVEL | 14 |
| REMAINING ROLLS  |  0 |
+------------------+----+
| ENEMY HEALTH     |  4 |
| ENEMIES KILLED   |  1 |
+------------------+----+

You ran out of dice rolls, game over.
