## Getting started

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

## Development

```
$ npm watch (starts the typescript compilation watch)
```

## Example output

```
> Roll dice? (Y/n)

+-------+
| ●   ● |

+-------+

You roll a 5.
The enemy dodges, but the user strikes a glancing blow. The user’s panic is reduced by 1. The enemy loses 3 health points.

+------------------+----+
| YOUR STAMINA     |  4 |
| YOUR PANIC LEVEL | 12 |
| REMAINING ROLLS  | 10 |
+------------------+----+
| ENEMY HEALTH     |  7 |
| ENEMIES KILLED   |  1 |
+------------------+----+

You ran out of dice rolls, game over.
