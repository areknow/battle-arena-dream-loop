You roll a 4.
You are battling against the Thirsty Amaranth Stork.
The enemy backs away; the user’s stamina increases by 1.

+------------------+----+
| YOUR STAMINA     |  4 |
| YOUR PANIC LEVEL |  6 |
| REMAINING ROLLS  | 10 |
+------------------+----+
| ENEMY HEALTH     |  1 |
| ENEMIES KILLED   |  1 |
+------------------+----+

You ran out of dice rolls, game over.
