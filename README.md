You roll a 4.
You are battling against the Important Amethyst Lemming.
The user gets health, and their panic level increases by 2.

+------------------+----+
| YOUR STAMINA     |  6 |
| YOUR PANIC LEVEL | 14 |
| REMAINING ROLLS  |  0 |
+------------------+----+
| ENEMY HEALTH     |  7 |
| ENEMIES KILLED   |  1 |
+------------------+----+

You ran out of dice rolls, game over.
